Step 1: Create a New Branch

Create a branch named feature:

git branch feature



Step 2: Verify Current Branch

List all branches:

git branch


⭐ The * symbol shows the currently active branch (e.g., * main).

Step 3: Checkout the New Branch

Switch to the feature branch:

git checkout feature


Step 4: Verify Current Branch

Check active branch:

git branch


Now * feature will be active.

Modify the file:

echo " This is a new feature" >> hello.py


View changes:

cat hello.py



Step 5: Stage the Modified File
git status
git add hello.py
git status

Step 6: Commit the Changes
git commit -m "Added a new feature line to hello.py"
git log


This saves the new changes in the feature branch.


Step 7: 
Checkout Main Branch # command

Switch back to main branch:

git checkout main
git branch


Step 8: Merge the Feature Branch into Main

Merge changes:

git merge feature


This brings all updates from feature into main.
Verify changes:

cat hello.py



Step 9: Push Changes to Remote Repository

Generate a Personal Access Token (Classic) on GitHub if not already done, then push:

git push -u origin main

git remote set-url origin https://......

Check your GitHub repository — the updates will appear there.



Step 10: Delete the Feature Branch

View all branches:

git branch


Delete the branch:

git branch -d feature


Verify deletion:

git branch
